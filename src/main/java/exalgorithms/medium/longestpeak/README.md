## Longest Peak

### Description
Given an Integer and an array of Integers, return the longest peak. 

A peak its defined as an adjacent elements are strictly increasing until reaches the highest value before to start strictly decreasing. At least 3 integers are required to be consider as a Peak.

### Example

Input
```java
inputArray = [1,2,2,4,0,2,3,4,8,6,2,-1,0,5,1]
```

Output
```java
8 // Due to 0,2,3,4,8,6,2,-1
```

Note: Notice that we have another Peak, however the length is less (4) than the above.
```java
-1,0,5,1
```
